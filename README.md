A Planetary Annihilation UI Mod

## Description ##
This is a modification for the popular real-time strategy game: Planetary Annihilation.

In general it adds many more ways to select units. Specifically it currently has these two features:
- **Select Previous Selection:** Keeps a history of up to the last 32 selections you made. ("Select Next Selection" is planned).
- **Cycle One in Selection:** Cycles through each individual unit of the current selection.

Both features are compatible with each other. Try it and you'll see.
